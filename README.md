# Code Refactoring: HTML and CSS

In this code refactoring exercise, we have made significant improvements to the structure and organization of both the HTML and CSS files. The goal was to improve readability, maintainability, and adhere to semantic coding practices.

## HTML Changes

- Removed unnecessary div elements and replaced them with appropriate semantic tags where applicable.
- Added comments to clearly delineate different sections of the HTML code.
- Adjusted indentation and formatting for improved readability.

## CSS Changes

- Grouped related selectors together to improve organization and readability.
- Removed redundant properties and values.
- Added comments to describe different sections of the CSS code.
- Organized the CSS rules in a logical order for easier maintenance.

## Overall Benefits

These changes have several advantages:

- Improved code readability: The code is now easier to understand and navigate, making it more maintainable in the long run.
- Semantic structure: By using appropriate HTML tags and CSS classes, the code now follows best practices for a semantic structure, improving accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
- Reduced code redundancy: Unnecessary properties and values were removed, leading to cleaner and more efficient code.
- Enhanced maintainability: The code is now better organized and documented, making it easier for future developers to modify and update.

Please review the updated HTML and CSS files to see the detailed changes made. Feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for further improvements.
